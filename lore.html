        <p>

            Zeus is known by many as the King of the Gods,
            the god of the sky, weather, among others. He is often
            shown as a tall figure with a white beard and a toga. 
            Zeus emerged as a pivotal figure in Greek mythology, 
            overcoming the challenges posed by his father Kronos and 
            establishing himself as the ruler of the the gods.
        </p>

        <p>

            He was born as the sole son of Kronos and Rhea, 
            as unfortunately his dad ate all of his brothers.
            Zeus was able to escape because his mother hid 
            him in a Cretan cave. Later in his life, Zeus
            made a potion that forced his father Kronos to
            regurgitate all five of his former brothers.
        </p>

        <p>

            While being raised on Mt. Dikte (on the 
            island of Crete), Zeus was nutured with
            milk from Amalthea (a she-goat) and 
            was raised by nymphs. He was protected by a
            warrior named Kouretes who once saved young Zeus by
            drowning out the sound of his crying with a
            battle-dance.

        <p class="subsection"><b>SYMBOLOGY</b></p>

        <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/image/7597001"><img src="images/zeus_bolt.JPG" class="zeus_bolt" alt="zeus_bolt"></a>

        <p>
            The main symbols that Zeus is recognized for
            is the thunderbolt, which he often wields in
            his hand. This weapon was forged by a Cyclops
            specifically for him, as a reward. While this is the most 
            significant symbology attributed to Zeus, the eagle and
            the bull are also often used. Zeus is
            often seen with a crown of olives on top of
            his head.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, the aegis is a protective cloak or shield 
            closely associated with Zeus. It often 
            features the head of the Gorgon Medusa and 
            is a symbol of divine protection. Athena, 
            another deity in the Greek pantheon, is 
            also commonly depicted with the aegis.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, the oak tree is sacred to Zeus, and 
            in some myths about his origin, he is said 
            to have been born or concealed in a sacred 
            oak grove. The oak represents strength, 
            endurance, and the sacred nature of certain 
            locations associated with the god.

        <p>
            The main power that the Greeks believed Zeus
            possessed was control over the weather. Thus,
            he was often thought to be the god behind many
            powerful storms and torrential downpours that
            would strike Greece. It is said that Zeus would
            be quite vengeful when he felt forgotten about, creating
            droughts which would lead to famine in ancient Greece.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to controlling weather phenomena,
            Zeus was immortal (as all Greek gods were), meaning he did not age
            once he reached maturity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, Zeus was known to be able to shapeshift
            in order to visit the mortal realm and walk around
            among them. This resulted in Zeus having multiple children
            with mortal women, resulting in multiple demigods. One
            of these demigods is Hercules, a well-known mythical 
            representation of strength and willpower.
